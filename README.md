## Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT – To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs. This application also aims to showcase how natural language can be used to interact with AI tools for practical productivity enhancement.

---

## AI Tools Required
- ChatGPT (Large Language Model by OpenAI)  
- Python (for command-line or backend processing)  
- Streamlit (for GUI interface – optional)  
- JSON or text files (for storing user preferences – optional)

---

## Explanation
This experiment involves creating a **Personal Productivity Assistant** that interacts in **natural language** and adapts to user inputs over time. This showcases the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in understanding, managing, and responding to real-world personal productivity needs.  

By building and refining prompts, students learn how LLMs process inputs, generate intelligent responses, and provide features like task management, scheduling, reminders, wellness suggestions, and general query handling.

---

## Prompt Used
> "Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."

---

## Procedure

1. **Define Core Features**
   - Daily Task Management
   - Smart Event Scheduling
   - Reminder Notifications
   - Wellness Advice System
   - General Information & Query Answering
   - Preference Adaptation (Memory Simulation)

2. **Prompt Construction**
   - Prompt design involves using natural conversational language to trigger specific features.
   - Examples:
     - Task: “Remind me to take my tablet every night at 9 PM.”
     - Scheduler: “Book a study session for Sunday 6 PM.”
     - Wellness: “Suggest a short breathing exercise.”
     - Memory: “Remember that I prefer tips about meditation over yoga.”

3. **Simulate User Interaction**
   - Using a Python script or CLI, simulate the assistant's responses.
   ```bash
   User: What’s on my schedule today?
   Assistant: You have 3 tasks today – 
   1. Submit project at 10 AM  
   2. Doctor’s appointment at 4 PM  
   3. Workout at 6 PM
   ```

4. **Memory Simulation (Optional)**
   - Store user preferences in a JSON file.
   - Adapt wellness suggestions, task style, or schedule reminders accordingly.

5. **Interface Design (Optional)**
   - Create a user interface using tools like Streamlit to make it visually interactive.

## Expected Output

### Daily Task Manager
```text
User: Remind me to call mom at 6 PM today.  
Assistant: Got it! I've scheduled a reminder to call your mom at 6 PM today.

User: What are my tasks for today?  
Assistant: Here's your schedule for today:  
1. Team meeting at 10:00 AM  
2. Submit lab report by 2:00 PM  
3. Call mom at 6:00 PM
```

---

### Smart Scheduler
```text
User: Schedule a study session on Sunday at 6 PM.  
Assistant: Study session scheduled for Sunday at 6 PM. You have no conflicting appointments.

User: Do I have any free slots this Saturday?  
Assistant: Yes, you're free between 2 PM and 5 PM on Saturday.
```

---

### Wellness Tip Generator
```text
User: Give me a wellness tip for the day.  
Assistant: Take a 5-minute walk every hour to reduce screen fatigue and improve focus.

User: I prefer meditation tips.  
Assistant: Try a 5-minute breathing meditation — inhale for 4s, hold for 4s, exhale for 4s.
```

---

### General Queries
```text
User: How do I improve concentration while studying?  
Assistant: Use the Pomodoro technique — 25 min study, 5 min break. Avoid phone distractions.
```

---

### Adaptive Behavior (Simulated Memory)
```text
User: Remember that I prefer getting reminders 10 minutes early.  
Assistant: Preference saved! I’ll remind you 10 minutes before events.

User: Suggest a break activity.  
Assistant: How about a quick stretch or a short breathing exercise? You’ve been sitting for a while!
```
